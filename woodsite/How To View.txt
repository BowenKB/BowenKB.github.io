This is how to view the website as if it was an actual webpage on an online server. Unfortunately I dont have the extra money to throw it online or I would!
It is all hand coded and designed by me using Brackets and the Adobe Suite for the design. I had a little help from an online resource for making the "carousel".
If you have any questions on how to open it or anything else feel free to email me. Hopefully this works on the first try!


1. Download this folder to a computer

2. Right-click on the swing_webpage.html

3. Hover over the "open with" option

4. Select Chrome as your browser

5. The site should open! :)
